Call-outs should be used when you want to call out information to the user. Call-outs look similar to banners but serve a different use case. Unlike banners, call-outs cannot be dismissed. They are optimized for long form copy (banners are optimized to save space and work at different widths). Also, there is no green call-out (there is a green banner). Call-outs should not have a CTA within them. Banners may sometimes have a button.

Below is the general spacing structure for call-outs:

## image

The type of call-out you use, should be used to convey a specific message to your user.

Don’t use colors to signify the intensity, but instead the type of information you’re communicating.

"Note" call-outs are used to show something that “may be nice to know”.

<Callout variant="note">
  You can also create API keys that applications use to connect to your MongoDB
  Stitch application. While these are not associated to a single user, they are
  listed in the Users tab. To learn more about API keys, see API Key
  Authentication.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout variant="note">
  Use <InlineCode>-h</InlineCode> or <InlineCode>--help</InlineCode> to view the
  command-line help for this command.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout variant="note">
  On some systems, there may be multiple INI files for individual SAPIs (e.g.
  CLI, FPM). Make sure to enable the extension in all SAPIs that you need.
</Callout>

<br />

"Important" call-outs are yellow and are used to show something that “may be important so pay attention”.

<Callout variant="important">
  For replica sets, <InlineCode>mongofiles</InlineCode> can only read from the
  set's primary.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout variant="important">
  <InlineCode>bsondump</InlineCode> is a diagnostic tool for inspecting{' '}
  <InlineCode>BSON</InlineCode>, not a tool for data ingestion or other
  application use.
</Callout>

<br />

"Warning" call-outs are red and are used to show something that could break or go wrong if the user is not aware of the information in the call-out.

<Callout variant="warning">
  If any of those namespaces already exist on your cluster when you attempt to
  load the sample data, the operation will fail and no sample data will load to
  your cluster.
</Callout>

<br />

There’s now also a purple "tip" call-out, which can be used to add a more personal note or suggestion from the Doc writer.

<Callout variant="tip">
  When possible, use a logical DNS hostname instead of an ip address,
  particularly when configuring replica set members. The use of logical DNS
  hostnames avoids configuration changes due to ip address changes.
</Callout>

<br />

Each call-out variant allows for a secondary title.

<Callout variant="note" title="Aggregation pipeline as alternative">
  <div
    className={css`
      margin-bottom: 16px;
    `}
  >
    Aggregation pipeline provides better performance and a more coherent
    interface than map-reduce.
  </div>
  <div
    className={css`
      margin-bottom: 16px;
    `}
  >
    Various map-reduce expressions can be rewritten using aggregation pipeline
    operators, such as <InlineCode>$group</InlineCode>, etc.
    <InlineCode>$merge</InlineCode>
  </div>
  The example below includes aggregation pipeline alternatives.
</Callout>

<Callout
  variant="important"
  title="When ugprading from MongoDB 4.0.6 or earlier to MongoDB 4.2"
>
  During the upgrade process, a client may try to resume change streams using
  the new <InlineCode>v1</InlineCode> resume token when connected to a member
  that has not updated (i.e. only accepts <InlineCode>v0</InlineCode> token) and
  fail. In such cases, the client must wait for the 4.2 upgrade to complete
  before resuming changestreams.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout variant="warning" title="Upgrading to version 1.3.0 and newer">
  Starting in MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator version 1.3.0, you can only
  have one MongoDB resource per project. To learn how to migrate your project to
  a single-cluster configuration see Migrate to One Resource per Project
  (Required for version 1.3.0).

We understand that sometimes it may be necessary, but try to avoid nesting call-outs in tables and other elements.

## example

Avoid nesting code components within call-outs.

## example

The example call-out is now deprecated. Don’t use it. Instead opt for integrating your example within body copy.
